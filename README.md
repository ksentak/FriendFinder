## How this App Works
Once the application is loaded, the user may begin by clicking the button that reads 'Click here to take a quiz!'. The user in then brought to a quiz page where they must enter their name, provide a link to an image of themself, and answer 10 personality-type questions. When the user completes the quiz, a modal will appear that will provide the user with who their cartoon best friend would be.
